# SecrartsCharacterController
A Unity character controller created by Secrart.



# Instructions
1. Simply add both of the ".cs" files to your unity project
2. Create an empty game object
3. Drag the "SecrartsCharacterControllerSetup.cs" into your empty game object 
(no need to add the "SecrartsGroundedCollider.cs" file)
4. Add 5 inputs: "Forward", "Backward", "Left", "Right", and "Crouch". (Case matters. Configure each one to the key you want it to be)
5. Voila character controller is implemented and ready to use. 

# Features
This character controller is *very* simple. It's not exactly "Triple A" quality. But it features most things you'd expect of a character controller. 

Walking, Jumping, Crouching, Gravity, and Slope Handling. 

NO SPRINT

sorry I- I'm too lazy to add it (probably will in an update if anybody cares) it should be simple to implement tho. 

# Side notes
Every public variable in the script is sorted by category and have tooltips to help you out.
